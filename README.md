# ZapStatus
Agile Status update for teams

This is basically a really quick "SPA" made in about 16hrs of on and off work while attending a conference, it allows teams to update their daily status without the need of a daily sync up.

As a fun experiment this also reports any blockers to our [LaMatric ticker](https://lametric.com), you'd need to create a LaMetric app that poll the data from firebase.

####Note:
Bear in mind that this was quickly put together in a really hacky manner while asisting to a conference, so don't expect fancy and clean code here.
